# libnvidia-container

This repository provides the necessary tools to build libnvidia-container for Unraid.  
Together with the [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://github.com/unraid/nvidia-container-toolkit) the [Nvidia Driver Plugin](https://github.com/unraid/unraid-nvidia-driver) allows users to fully utilize their Nvidia graphics cards in containerized applications on Unraid.

**Features:**
- Automated builds: Scheduled checks ensure that the libnvidia-container is always up-to-date with the latest versions.
- Simplified setup process for leveraging Nvidia GPUs with Docker on Unraid.
